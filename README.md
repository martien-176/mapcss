# Improve the readability of ways

These mapstyles improve the visibility of ways (highways, waterways, buildings). Highways and waterways have colors that are more pregnant. Very handy for validators that are inspecting an area when zoomed out. Or for areas that are full of other objects.

The buildings mapstyle has a style setting to choose the color and to vary the width of the outline of the building.
