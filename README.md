# mapcss
Improve the readability of some josm objects, eg highways.

I found the visibility of some highway types not very good. Especially when mapping rural areas in Africa tracks and paths are almost invisible.

So i created a mapstyle to improve this, by making the colors more pop.

Here you can find information about mapstyles and how to install them in Josm:
